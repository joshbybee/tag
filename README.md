# how about a nice game of tag
learning repo to create a simple tag game using unity


# planned features

1. you control a box that can move using WASD in a 3D space on a flat plane
2. a white box will spawn in on the plane and will move around semi-randomly 
3. if you navigate to the white box and collide with it, it will turn red and stop moving
4. after a few seconds, the red box will disappear and a new white box will spawn
5. each time you catch the box, a persistent number will increment in the upper left corner of the screen with your "score: n"
